# Outputs

This folder contains aggregated query results used to build Tableau visuals and summarize findings.

- `rockbuster-sql-outputs.xlsx` includes:
  - Customer overview (total/active/inactive)
  - Customers & revenue by country
  - Top 10 countries by customer count
  - Top 5 customers by total paid

Recommendation: export each tab to CSV over time for easier reuse in Tableau and easier review in GitHub.
